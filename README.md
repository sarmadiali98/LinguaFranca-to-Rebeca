# LinguaFranca-to-Rebeca
Welcome to the Lingua Franca to Rebeca Verification Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing and verifying the equivalence of models written in Lingua Franca (LF) and their corresponding counterparts in Rebeca. By providing side-by-side examples of LF code and its Rebeca translation, we aim to facilitate the understanding of how reactive systems can be modeled in these two languages. Feel free to explore the code examples, compare their functionalities, and use them as a reference for your own projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the repository further.
