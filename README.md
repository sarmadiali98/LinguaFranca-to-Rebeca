# LinguaFranca-to-Rebeca
Welcome to the Lingua Franca to Rebeca Verification Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing and verifying the equivalence of models written in Lingua Franca (LF) and their corresponding counterparts in Rebeca. By providing side-by-side examples of LF code and its Rebeca translation, we aim to facilitate the understanding of how reactive systems can be modeled in these two languages. Feel free to explore the code examples, compare their functionalities, and use them as a reference for your own projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the repository further.

## Sequential Composition
This repository contains a Rebeca model and its equivalent in Lingua Franca, demonstrating a reactive system composed of nodes that communicate in a sequence. Each node in the system can send and receive messages, and the first node initiates the communication with a predefined message. As messages are received, they are processed and forwarded to the next node, with the value being doubled at each step. When the last node in the sequence receives a message, it sends an acknowledgment back to the first node, completing the sequence. The models illustrate how such a system can be described in both Rebeca and Lingua Franca, providing a clear comparison for verification and educational purposes. The main reactor in both languages sets up a loop of nodes, ensuring continuous message passing and sequence execution.

## Circular Network
This repository contains a Rebeca model and its equivalent in Lingua Franca, demonstrating a reactive system where nodes periodically send a fixed message to the next node in a loop. Each node is configured with a specific period for sending messages and a network delay for message delivery. The first node initiates the communication cycle by sending a message with a predefined value. As each node receives a message, it simply records the received value and continues to send the same fixed message at its defined interval. The models illustrate how this periodic messaging system can be implemented in both Rebeca and Lingua Franca, providing a basis for verifying and understanding reactive system behaviors in different programming paradigms. The main reactor in both languages sets up a loop of nodes, ensuring continuous and periodic message passing.
